I found a WebView exploit that works on either the sign-in screen or the Kiosk Apps. (TestNav, Illuminate Secure, etc.) Basically when you sign in to a WIFI network 
like McDonald's or (District name) Guest, it opens a window called "Captive Portal".

NOTE: If trying to make the Captive Portal work on a phone, iPhone will not work due to apple limitations with WIFI. BUT if on an Android phone, use Tasker.

If you are able to open the window up (with McDonald's WIFI or other):
1: Click sign in with google account.
2: Click Privacy > waffle dots (9 dots).
3: Click Google.

Things noticed (some things are limited): Cannot right click, cannot change URL in URL bar, cannot use shortcuts, chrome urls (I have not tested if chrome URLs work), 
cannot install apps (have not tested chrome extensions), cannot open new windows (probably not in incognito mode), and others. 
(Have not tried going forward and backward on the window.)

I have not tested the WebView when clicked the sign in with google on Captive Portal WIFI. All I know that is it pops up a window.

If you are wondering how i did/know this (on Things Noticed), I used school guest WIFI, but it says connection not secure.
